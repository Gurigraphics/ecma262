name: "\U0001F680 Feature request is not here"
about: Suggest an idea for ECMA-262

---

This repository is only for handling issues with the specification itself.

New ideas, suggestions and discussions about future versions of ECMAScript should not be made in this repository.   

Feature Requests are developed in separate GitHub repositories,
which are then merged into the main repository once they have received "Stage 4". 

This four-stage process is documented in the [TC39 process document](https://tc39.es/process-document/).

TC39 is open to accepting new feature requests for ECMAScript, referred to as "proposals". 

To contribute visit [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
